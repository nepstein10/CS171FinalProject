                The Rise of Analytics in Basketball
            </div>
            <p class="story-text" style="height: 20%">
                One of the most publicized transformations in the history of the NBA, the rise of analytics has had a
                polarizing and profound impact on the way the game of basketball is played today. All 30 teams in the
                league now boast analytics personnel or departments—people sitting behind computers, crunching numbers,
                and impacting the outcome of games in their own uniquely cerebral way. But how has this wave of analytics
                actually impacted the way the game is played—have team strategies changed? Are certain types of shots more
                or less common now? Let’s dive in and find out.

                    but 50% higher in value. Use your mouse to brush over the chart on the right to control the time

            <div>
                So the league as a whole is embracing the three point shot like never before and casting aside the once
                celebrated long-two. But how does this change look at the individual level? Let's start with the league's
                best. The players featured in the next chart are superstars, considered the best-of-the-best of their
                respective eras. We have organized these players into four eras—the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s—based
                on when they were drafted and/or achieved their peak level of play. Let's see how they stack up to each
                other when it comes to three point shot selection.

            <div>
                Decade-by-decade, the three point shot has become more popular among the league's best players. But what is
                particularly startling is the rate at which players of the modern era are taking them compared
                to past generations. Players like Steph Curry and James Harden have barely scratched the career longevitiy
                of a Kobe Bryant, but have already far surpassed him when it comes to total three pointers taken. There
                are of course exceptions to this trend. Players such as Giannis Antetokounmpo and Anthony Davis show that
                you can still be a superstar in today's league while doing most of your damage inside the three point line.

            <div>
                Use the position filter to compare players across the same position. The trend is consistent across the
                board: players of today who are just halfway or less into their careers have already
                launched more threes than many of their peers from past eras. The trend for bigs is
                especially eye-opening: even skilled post players like Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic must take a steady
                diet of threes just by nature of the way the game is played today. A few outliers aside, most bigs in
                the 90s and 2000s would rarely ever attempt a three. Notice the heavy clustering of lines at the
                bottom of the big-filtered chart.

                Think guys like Larry Bird, Ray Allen, and Reggie Miller would frequently launch the ball from deep?
                Well, you might want to re-think that notion as we compare them to some of the current league’s average
                Joes. What were once historic rates of three point shot attempts are now being outdone by
                perennial bench players.

            <div>
                In the 90s and 2000s, if you wanted to take a bunch of threes, you had to be an excellent shooter. The
                same cannot be said anymore in this era of basketball. Average shooters are hoisting up as many,
                or more, shots than the likes of Ray Allen and Reggie Miller. When looking at the chart above, keep
                in mind that the difference between a ~40% and ~35% three point shooter is considered substantial by
                NBA standards.
