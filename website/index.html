                The Rise of Basketball Analytics
            </div>
            <p class="story-text" style="height: 30%">
                One of the most publicized transformations in the history of the NBA, the rise of analytics, has had a
                polarizing and profound impact on the way the game of basketball is played today. All 30 teams in the
                league now boast analytics personnel or departments—people sitting behind computers, crunching numbers,
                and impacting the outcome of games in their own uniquely cerebral way. But how has this wave of analytics
                actually impacted the way the game is played—have team strategies changed? Are certain types of shots more
                or less common now? Let’s dive in and find out.

                Does this trend hold through for all groups of players?

            <p class="story-text">
                So the league as a whole is embracing the three point shot like never before and casting aside the once
                celebrated long-two. But how does this change look at the individual level? Let's start with the league's
                best. The players featured in the next chart are superstars, considered the best-of-the-best of their
                respective eras. We have organized these players into four groups—the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s—based
                on when they were drafted and/or achieved their peak level of play. Let's see how they stack up to each
                other when it comes to three point shot selection.

            </div>
            <p class="story-text">
                Decade-by-decade, the three point shot has become more popular among the league's best players. But what is
                particularly startling is the rate at which players of the modern era are taking them compared
                to past generations. Players like Steph Curry and James Harden have barely scratched the career longevitiy
                of a Kobe Bryant, but have already far surpassed him when it comes to total three pointers taken. There
                are of course exceptions to this trend. Players such as Giannis Antetokounmpo and Anthony Davis show that
                you can still be a superstar in today's league while doing most of your damage inside the three point line.

                The trend is consistent across the board: superstar players of today who are just halfway into
                their careers have already launched more threes than many of their peers from past eras. The trend for
                bigs is especially eye-opening: even skilled post players like Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic take a
                steady diet of threes just by nature of the way the game is played today. A few outliers aside, most
                bigs in the 90s and 2000s would rarely ever attempt a three.

                or more, shots than the likes of Ray Allen and Reggie Miller. When looking at the chart above, keep

            <div>
                Basketball has turned into a game of numbers. While there was once a lush diversity of shot frequencies
                across the hardwood, we now see a regimented, economical divide into three point shots and paint shots,
                with very little in between. Post shots and long midrange shots, the bread and butter of generations of
                NBA legends from Bird to Kobe, have practically been forsaken with the rise of the analytics
                movement. While this evolution makes sense from a pure efficiency standpoint, the question must be begged:
                is it actually good for the sport? Many fans and analysts alike have responded with a resounding "no."

                <br>
                So what can be done? The league-wide shift towards shooting more threes was the result of a basic distortion
                in incentives: instead of shooting the midrange, players could simply shoot the ball from a few steps
                further back for a 50% higher payoff. Once teams and players truly grasped this fact, they all started
                exploiting it. Perhaps now we need a new change in incentives. For instance, some have suggested that the three point line could be
                pushed further back, so the shot becomes more challenging and less efficient. Or perhaps NBA officiating
                should begin to loosen up on the perimeter, allowing defenses to disrupt three point attempts more
                effectively. The options are numerous and the NBA shouldn't shy away from embracing major change. After all,
                the introduction of the three point line in 1979 was itself one of the most radical changes in all of sports.
